# What do I need?

A PC:
* Basic level: To install and launch the Robot Devastation game itself (interface of movement, shots, etc), the simplest is to use a PC with some version of Ubuntu ([here a video of how to install Ubuntu 14.10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iez8JyCd8ts)).
 * [How to install Robot Devastation on Ubuntu 14.10](http://asrob.uc3m.es/index.php/C%C3%B3mo_instalar_Robot_Devastation_sobre_Ubuntu_14.10).
* Intermediate Level: A mid-level user can start by testing a GNU / Linux based operating system such as Debian, Ubuntu or Linux Mint.
* Advanced Level: Game source code must be able to be compiled and run smoothly on any Linux-based operating system, and on Mac and Windows as well. However, we have not yet succeeded.

A robot: (although you can try and debug without a robot, see below, better with a robot!))
* Basic level: The RD2 robot.
 * [How to mount the RD2 robot](http://asrob.uc3m.es/index.php/C%C3%B3mo_montar_el_robot_RD2).
* Advanced Level: Build a robot that has the following elements.
 * To be called a robot, you will have at least one motor (e.g. a pair of servomotors).
 * In order to send you motion commands, you will need wifi (e.g. a USB wifi module).
 * In order to visualize what the robot sees, you will need at least one camera (e.g. a USB webcam).
 * To be able to integrate everything at hardware / software level, you will need a mini-PC (e.g. a Raspberry Pi).
 * To be able to integrate everything at a structural level, you will need a support in addition to some wheels.
 * In order to power it, you will need batteries or a similar power source.
