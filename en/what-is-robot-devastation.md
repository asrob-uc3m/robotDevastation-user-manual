# What is Robot Devastation?
Robot Devastation is an Augmented Reality (AR) game that emulates robot combats.

The player assumes the role of the robot pilot, as if he were sitting inside the robot cockpit, and battles against other robots. Weapons and projectiles, as well as bullets, fire, explosions and damage inflicted to the robots are simulated using AR. This prevents damage to the player, other people around the robots, or the robots themselves, and at the same time it provides engaging gameplay. Virtual Non-Playing Character (NPC) autonomous robots can be added to balance teams or to increase game difficulty.
