# Robot Devastation User Manual

Welcome to the Robot Devastation User Manual. In this page we give some guides to start from scratch with [Robot Devastation](http://asrob.uc3m.es/index.php/Robot_Devastation).

Note these guides represent the current state of development and may be modified with the improvements we incorporate. This book is generated by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/asrob-uc3m/robotdevastation-user-manual), and its sources are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/asrob-uc3m/robotDevastation-user-manual).
