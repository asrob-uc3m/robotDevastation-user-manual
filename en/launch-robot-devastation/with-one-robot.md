# Launch Robot Devastation - With One Remote Robot

Having followed the PC installation steps, open a terminal (on Ubuntu 10.04 - 14.10 and other distributions, a console can be accessed through the combination of the three simultaneous keys `CTRL ALT t`) and run (write and press `enter`):

```bash
yarp server
```

In a new terminal, run:

```bash
rdServer
```

Turn robot on. In another new terminal, run:

```bash
robotDevastation --robotName rd2
```

Play!
